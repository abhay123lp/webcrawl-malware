Introduction
1. alexatop.py is used to grab the top 500 benign websites (assumed benign). The result is stored in ../data/URLs. 
2. chromeDeob.py is used to automate the modified Chromium to generate javascript files from ../data/URLs and output to ../data/JSFileWComments.
3. rmcomment.py is used to remove comments for JS files. This program will read javascript files from ../data/JSFileWComments and write to ../data/JSFiles.
4. deobtool.py (not working now) is used to automate the modified Chromium to generate javascript files as well. The difference is that this program uses selenium to gain control of the browser. Therefore, we can perform click etc on the websites. 
   It is not working now because the selenium chrome driver works on stable version of chrome and chromium, for self-built latest version of chromium, I haven't figured out how to use this yet.
5. deob.py aggregate all the useful program to get the deobfuscated JS for a given URL.
python deob.py test $url 
	will output the deobed JS to data/JSTest,
python deob.py $regex
	will output the deobed JS for all url list files matching regex.


How to use
python alexatop.py
python chromeDeob.py
python rmcomment.py
python deob.py

Note: Look into source code for the absolute path of chrome binary. Replace those address with your chrome binary directory.


Dependencies
1. I am using Debian to do all the experiments. The following description is based on Debian Squeeze 6 (64 bit). If you are using Ubuntu or other systems, there will be some difference. Please refer to those wikis for instructions.
2. To get the chromium working, there are many libraries to installed. Please refer to the wiki to chromium on how to download and build. (http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxBuildInstructions)
3. For chromedriver, first download it. To use chromedriver for selenium, you need to install glibc and libstdc++ for experimental on debian (refer to http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=222038).
   This is dangerous, because you are making change to very basic c library. Regarding programming with chromedriver on selenium, refer to http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver.
4. To support incremental gunzip, gzip 1.6 need to be installed. Please refer to http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/development/chapter06/gzip.html.
5. To disable chrome safe browsing, start chrome and set this in 'Settings'.
6. To disale chrome session restore, go to chrome://flags, click 'disable better session restore'.
