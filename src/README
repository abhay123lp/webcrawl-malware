Introduction
1. This webcrawl project aims at building a tool to analyze malware and look into the life cycle of malware.
2. The first step is to implement a tool similar to Zozzle. Please check this http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/152618/usenixsec11b.pdf to see the steps to implement Zozzle.
3. Currently, we are still in the first step. We made several changes in implementation. First, we are using chrome instead of Internet Explorer. Second, we are expanding those features, e.g. the feature flow.
4. What we can do now is that given a URL, we can output the features, which can be done by urltofeature.sh after configuration.

How to use
1. Read ./deob/README ./v8/README and ./parser/JS_Feature_Extraction/README on how these file works and how to use those files.
2. After all the configuration. Just run urltofeature.sh
